			 	Spread of Rabbits:
				<p class="contentp">
				  Rabbits are originally from Spain, parts of Africa and Portugal, but they are now found in many parts of the world including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Rabbits were found by the Romans and they were taken to Thetford, Norfolk to breed for food and clothing, which was made up of their fur. Rabbits were penned to keep from escaping, after the fall of the Romans, most of the population escaped into the wild and grew rapidly. Eventually, rabbits spread across Europe and were later brought to many other countries through the expeditions of the Europeans to the Americas, Australia and parts of Asia.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why Rabbits Spread so Fast:
				<p class="contentp">
				Rabbits were able spread so quickly across Australia and other areas because there was a perfect environment for them to settle and breed.  In the beginning there were 24 rabbits, but now, there are thousands. This was mainly due to the fact that all the predators in Australia were not adapted to eating rabbits. Because rabbits had no predators in Australia they thrived. In addition, rabbits also breed rapidly, which allowed the population to grow very rapidly, especially when they were left unchecked.

				<p>
				  What Rabbits are Doing:
				</p>
				<p class="contentp">
	        Rabbits have been eating the countryside grass and crops, making less food for humans to eat. They also have been mating and breeding more rabbits to increase their numbers
