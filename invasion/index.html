			 	Spread of Rabbits:
			 	</p>
				<p class="contentp">
				  Rabbits are originally from Spain, parts of Africa and Portugal, but they are now found in many parts of the world including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. Rabbits were found by the Romans and they were taken to Thetford, Norfolk to breed for food and clothing, which was made up of their fur. Rabbits were penned to keep from escaping, after the fall of the Romans, most of the population escaped into the wild and grew rapidly. Eventually, rabbits spread across Europe and were later brought to many other countries through the expeditions of the Europeans to the Americas, Australia and parts of Asia.
				</p>
				<p class="headerp">
					Why Rabbits Spread so Fast:
					</p>
				<p class="contentp">
				Rabbits were able spread so quickly across Australia and other areas because there was a perfect environment for them to settle and breed.  In the beginning there were 24 rabbits, but now, there are thousands. This was mainly due to the fact that all the predators in Australia were not adapted to eating rabbits. Because rabbits had no predators in Australia they thrived. In addition, rabbits also breed rapidly, which allowed the population to grow very rapidly, especially when they were left unchecked.
				</p>
				<p class="headerp">
				  What Rabbits are Doing:
				</p>
				<p class="contentp">
	        		Rabbits have been eating the countryside grass and crops, making less food for humans to eat. They also have been mating and breeding more rabbits to increase their numbers.
				</p>
				<p class="headerp">
					Affecting Life:
					</p>
				<p class="contentp">
				Rabbits can be adopted for a pet, but wild rabbits are still a problem. Rabbits have been ruining biodiversity by endangering lots of native animals and plants in Australia. The native species that also eat and live like the rabbits have been endangered. They have lost the competition for food and space because there was just too many rabbits. The ecosystem have also been losing native plants because of the bunnies. This is why pest control are trying as hard as they can to control the population or rabbits.

					Advantages About Rabbits:
					</p>
				<p class="contentp">
				Some advantages to having rabbits are that they provide tons of food for predators because of their numerous numbers. Rabbit also stops plants from over growing.
				</p>
				<p class="headerp">
					Ways to Control Rabbit Population:
				</p>
				<p class="contentp">
					Countries such as Australia have attempted to limit the population of rabbits by encouraging the hunting and killing of rabbit populations. Australia is known for creating the world’s longest connected fence, titled the “Dingo Fence”, separating the South East of Australia, in which the rabbit population had been controlled from the relatively wild other parts of the continent. However, due to the tunneling abilities of rabbits, the fence was not successful in its purpose and once again, the population of rabbits grew in the civilized parts of Australia. As with most all other invasive species, it is very nearly impossible to remove their presence. People have also been trying to poison or set fire to rabbit’s homes to control rabbit population. A disease called VHD and Myxomatosis has been cause huge damage to the population. The procedure and to do research on controlling rabbits have been costing millions of dollars.
